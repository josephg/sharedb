# ShareDB

ShareDb is a database for concurrently editable documents.

Its a C port of [ShareJS](https://github.com/josephg/ShareJS) by ShareJS's author.
The port is designed to replace the original server code, while maintaining application compatibility.

Its new and really buggy. Don't use it for anything yet - its weeks old, and barely baked.
